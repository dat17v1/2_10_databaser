# SQL - SELECT and INSERT Exercises

Solve these exercises and write the solution in a text file and call it my_first_sql_exercises.sql. 

You should use the database "[my_first_database.sql](https://github.com/dat17v1/2_10_databaser/blob/master/materials/my_first_database.sql)"    

The content of this file you copy and then paste it into the Console window (database - intelliJ) and hit the execute button. Then you will have a database called my_first_database.

## Write the SQL statements for:
